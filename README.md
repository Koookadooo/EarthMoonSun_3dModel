This model show the earth rotating around the sun while the moon rotates around the earth. Each of the celectial bodies are also rotating on their own axis.
The program utilizes OpenGL to build the planets and govern their lighting, motion, and animation.
The planets are all textured using .bmp files. The earth and moon utilize lighting that looks like it is coming from the sun while the sun it not itself lit using GLUT.

The model is able to show different perspective by using different key strkes while the model is running. You are also able to use the mouse to change viewing angle and Zoom-out/Zoom-in 

Model is not to scale as it would be quite hard to visualize. Please see this video which shows and demos the project in depth -- [Model Demo](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/1_q79127cp)
